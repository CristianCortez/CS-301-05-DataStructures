Assignment #3

Unsorted list

Implement an unsorted list from the text and lecture. Create a driver to do the following:

-prompt user for the name of the input file to use

-prompt user for the name of the output file to use

-prompt user for the name of the test run

-open the input file, reading line by line, and execute the instructions

-display the result to the console and write the result to the output file


The input file can include the following commands:

GetLength

PutItem

PrintList

GetItem

IsFull

DeleteItem

PrintList

MakeEmpty

Quit

Any other commands should result in printing “<command> is not a valid command”.

Each line of the input file will be a command to execute on your unsortedList instance. Use the attached input file, listData for your project.
