Dynamic Stack Template


First, implement a Dynamic Stack Template with pop, push, and isEmpty.

This should be a template class that can accept any type.

 

Next, write a program to reverse files using your dynamic stack.

Write a program that opens a text file and reads its contents into a stack of characters.

The program should then pop the characters from the stack and save them in a second

text file. The order of the characters saved in the second file should be the reverse of

their order in the first file.
