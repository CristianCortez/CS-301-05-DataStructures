Create a Queue Converter

First, write a binary search tree class. It can be of type int or as a template.

Next, write a driver that stores a series of numbers in your binary search tree. The values should be read in from a file and displayed on the screen. The file should contain 100 or more elements. For each element read, insert the value from the BST into a queue in ascending (inorder) order. Dequeue the values and display them on the screen to confirm that they were stored in the proper order.

The driver for this assignment should demonstrate the features and use of the Q class. Be sure to write a good driver!
